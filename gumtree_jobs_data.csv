She loves music (she is learning piano), singing, visiting art galleries, going trampolining and to a local youth club, and as a treat, having her nails done! She is inquisitive and likes to explore and ask questions on subjects that interest her. Sarah has a diagnosis of Autism which presents mainly with sensory challenges and difficulty in regulating emotions. She can have the odd meltdown if she gets overwhelmed, perhaps because of sudden loud noises, she is tired, or she has had a bad day at school, but this is becoming less and less. At times like this, she needs her own space and not to be crowded to help her calm down. Sarah receives OT support at school and is working on her fine and gross motor skills. Sarah is quite independent but sometimes needs help with certain activities and prompts for personal care. Sarah loves routine and a visual timetable works well for her.  Overview of role:  Sarah is brought back from school, so you will meet her at the house to provide after-school support. The key areas to support Sarah will be socialisation, helping her independence and life skills and overseeing homework. There are also activities to take her to such as going to the park, trampolining and the local youth club and preparing Sarah’s evening meal. During the school holidays there’s time to arrange activities further afield for Sarah to enjoy.  Who this job would suit:  I asked Sarah what type of person she would like us to find and she was very quick to respond – happy! She would also like someone who can enjoy the activities she likes, such as visiting museums, languages, music, and drama. The successful *female, SEN Nanny will be outgoing, confident, experienced working with young people who are autistic and an effective communicator to help develop Sarah’s communication and social interaction skills. This role will suit candidates who enjoy getting involved in activities. Whilst a driver with their own car would be ideal, a car will be provided for the right candidate for use on duty.
