Advice and signposting are offered by the team to referrers/carers/self-referrals if a clinical high risk state for bipolar is not met. OASIS-BAR will also provide an extensive outreach program to statutory organisations, including health services, GPs and social care providers, to educate about who might be at risk of developing bipolar disorders, how to identify these young people, and how to refer to the service. OASIS-BAR will also provide an extensive community engagement program to non-statutory health services such as faith groups, colleges, universities, members of the public and other voluntary sector providers.

Highbridge - Our Practice & Town  Highbridge Medical Centre is a large, well established practice with an on-site pharmacy. Our integrated, multidisciplinary team includes nurse practitioners and ECPs and provides a wide range of services to around 12,000 patients. We are part of Symphony Healthcare Services, the largest GP provider in Somerset so benefit from the experience and learning across a network of 20 practices.

Please read on…  Our transport links are great - The M5, Bristol Airport and train routes to London mean that Highbridge is very conveniently located.  Highbridge is a charming town based on the edge of the Somerset Levels. The area is surrounded by sandy coast with Burnham-on- Sea and its iconic lighthouse a stone’s throw, and sandwiched between the Mendip Hills and Quantocks for exploring, horse-riding and mountain biking. Highbridge is a bustling town with a number of eateries, restaurants, and shops.  The role  You would undertake all the clinical duties associated with a GP working in primary care, without the responsibilities and risks associated with being a partner. We can offer opportunities from salaried through to employed and consultant level GP posts depending on your experience and the level of responsibility you take on at the practice.  All GPs working for us are paid as Employees, unlike Partners, which means less risk for you and more time to focus on patient care.

However, our Salaried GPs have a clearly defined job plan setting out the hours of work and responsibility and tasks associated with the role.  Through annual appraisal, we encourage career development and progression and are keen to support GPs who wish to extend their role, or have specialist skills which can be utilised in primary care. We recognise that some GPs will wish to stay salaried, and some will wish to assume more responsibility once they have found their feet and aspire to Employed or Consultant roles.  About Symphony Healthcare Services  Symphony Healthcare Services was established in 2016 as part of the award-winning Symphony Programme Vanguard, developing new models of care. We now support 20 practices across Somerset (including one in Devon) providing care for 120,000 patients.  Symphony has developed a model where each practice is encouraged to operate autonomously, but as a subsidiary of Yeovil Hospital and with the backing and economies of scale from a central support team (particularly for HR and strategic management matters).  Providing NHS services is at the heart of what we do. Our vision is to ensure that primary care is sustainable for patients and practices in Somerset, and we aim to be a national exemplar for primary care provision. We work closely with our practice teams to support, develop and transform patient care and working practices with innovation and technology at the heart of what we do. We also work hard to make sure primary care has a loud voice in Somerset.  Highbridge Medical Centre joined Symphony Healthcare Services in 2017. By working at scale in primary care in Somerset we can offer you the opportunity to develop specialist skills with the support of a larger organisation to develop your GP career.

The position is open to recent graduates/early career professionals. The full time position can be split into two part time flexible roles. The only thing we ask is you possess the right to work in the United Kingdom and have RCVS eligibility to practice in the UK.  We are a mixed practice predominantly equine and small animal, and this new position will the give the right individual both the opportunity and scope to excel in either clinical sphere (equine or small animal) or a combination of the two. We are currently growing the equine side of the practice. Purpose built clinic and equine rehabilitation centre on site.  Package includes a car; generous CPD budget (study for certificates actively encouraged); RCVS fees & VDS cover; salary commensurate with experience. Accommodation in a beautiful period feature cottage set in 20 acres of grassland is also available if required. Shared out of hours rota.  If you have an interest in equine and/or small animal then contact us, whilst experience is preferred it is not essential. Our new graduate mentoring and support programme is second to none and we pride ourselves on giving the successful applicant the tools, and support to succeed (see below) .  Our Graduate Program  Our graduate mixed practice programme is second to none with one-to-one mentoring and support from our senior vets. Day or night, help is always on hand if you need it. One of our former graduates has gone on to complete an internship at New Market Equine Hospital.  How And What You Will Learn  Our graduate programme facilitates development of all core practical skills across the species giving a good foundation to continue your personal development either as a mixed practice practitioner or enable you to focus on a more species specific career. You will be teamed up with one of our senior veterinary surgeons (also a trained GDP mentor) for the duration of your graduate programme, who will not only be there to support and mentor you with your veterinary training, helping you achieve you goals, and be the very best vet you can be, but who will also be there to support you emotionally and mentally 24/7. Initially you will be shadowing your mentor helping make the transition from student to veterinary surgeon a smooth and natural process.  Over time you will gradually build up your skills becoming proficient in mixed veterinary practice. It is so important to have the right support in your early years as a veterinary surgeon, and no one understands this more that the team at Stoven Hall.  Nothing prides us more at Stoven Hall Vets than to help you grow and flourish in your veterinary career, fulfil your goals and ambitions and become the very best veterinary surgeon you can be.  One of our senior vets holds an ESVPS postgraduate certificate (GPCert(EqP)) in equine practice, and the practice actively encourages studying for a certificate with funding available at the practice to help facilitate this.  What Happens After You Apply  Once we have received your application/CV we will contact you within 48 hours to discuss your application in more detail and give you the opportunity to ask all the questions you may have about the practice. If all goes well we will then invite you to Stoven Hall Veterinary Clinic to come and spend some time with us, meet our fantastic team and get a real feel for the practice and what we are all about. We have accommodation available in a beautiful period feature detached cottage if you would like to stay for a few days or prefer to split your journey over two days. Following your visit we will then contact you again, normally within a few days of your interview/visit, to answer any further questions/queries you may have and and let you know the outcome of your application.  A Bit About Us  Stoven Hall Vets (formerly Stoven Hall Equine Clinic) was set up in 2011 as a purely equine practice with planning permission for a large equine rehabilitation centre on site to complement the veterinary services and treatment. Since 2011 the practice has continued to grow and expand, and now also cares for companion animals. Some of our horse clients also have small holdings/hobby farms, so we do see the occasional ruminant, alpaca or meerkat!! We have also been on the BBC’s Countryfile.  Located within 60 miles of Newmarket we have easy access to both Rossdales Equine Hospital and Newmarket Equine Hospital for referring cases and visiting equine dental specialist vets (Chris Pearce and colleagues) from the Equine Dental Clinic in Wimbourne.  Set in 20 acres of farmland (pasture) with paddocks, an exercise track, 60x30m outdoor floodlit ménage, internal stables and a bespoke equine examination room including stocks, it is not only a beautiful place to work but perfect for treating horses and those requiring rest and rehabilitation. The practice has the usual toys including respiratory scope, 3metre gastroscope, ultrasound including colour flow Doppler, ECG, digital x-ray machine, HDE dental power tool system etc. We are in the process of purchasing in house blood machines and a new dental oroscope system.  In addition to the large animal examination room we have a waiting room, consult room, hospitalisation facilities and an operating theatre (including a state of the art dental machine) for our small animal patients. With 15 minute consultation appointments as a minimum, we can ensure our clients and patients receive our full attention and time that they need.  We are looking for a motivated, diligent, conscientious team player, with good communication skills and empathy for our patients and clients to help grow and expand the equine side of the practice with some small animal. A good sense of humour is essential as is a liking of cake!!!  They say good things come in small packages!! We are a small practice and team who are more like family than work colleagues, it is not uncommon for us to socialise outside of work. Out with Covid times we have a Christmas party each year for our clients, hold charity fund raising events, the most recent being our “Paws on Parade” in aid of the Air Ambulance and client evenings. Being small, we know all our clients and their animals individually, which not only creates a fantastic working atmosphere but a special rapport with our clients. Many of you are probably too young to remember James Herriot but the best way I can describe us is we are the modern version of Skeldale.  We are minutes away from the beach, 5 minutes from the prestigious Southwold pier and beach, close to the Norfolk Broads for those that like sailing and paddle boarding, and for those festival goers, Latitude festival is just up the road …. you can hear the bands from the clinic grounds!! We are located within easy access to London by bus and train and a 45 minutes drive from Norwich Airport with good road links to other parts of the country. Stoven with Brampton also has an amazing village primary school just up the road from the clinic.  We are an independent practice and will always remain so. Looking to take the next step in your career? Aspirations to become a partner or own a practice? This job opportunity has the potential to allow you to achieve your goals, with long term prospects for the right person. We can also consider splitting the full time role into two part-time positions, which may suit individuals returning to work after maternity leave, families with children, or individuals wishing to work more flexible hours.

The successful candidate will have a specialist interest in heart failure with additional interest in Inherited cardiac disease and complex imaging The successful candidate will work in partnership with our expanding Heart Failure team of specialist nurses and consultants as well as supporting our Inherited Cardiac disease (ICC) and Imaging departments.  Watford General hospital and Hemel Hempstead hospital are situated in Hertfordshire, easily accessible via the M1 and M25 Motorways and within easy access to the city of London by public transport.  Please see attached JD for additional details pertaining to the main duties of post.  This post is designed to support the ever-increasing workload in cardiology with a shared emphasis in heart failure, ICC and cardiac imaging.  The cardiology service is working in partnership with primary care to develop the local heart failure service with a contract with the Community heart failure team to provide clinic access to secondary care.  During the 2019 Covid pandemic, West Herts was the first Trust in the country to pioneer the Virtual Hospital model of care, allowing early discharge of patients and providing supported care at home using state of the art technologies.  In 2022, alongside our primary care partners, the department was further awarded over £1million in investment to continue this work with particular focus on Heart Failure. Our Virtual Hospital model has had a marked impact at local and National level and continues to thrive within WHTHT. This post provides an exciting opportunity to further develop and support the heart failure service which has expanded tremendously over the last 2 years alongside the increased demand for complex imaging and crossover with Inherited cardiac diseases such as cardiomyopathy and it is therefore likely to lead to a substantive appointment.  There has never been a more exciting time to join West Hertfordshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust!  The Trust is in line to receive government funding for major redevelopment works with construction due to start on new buildings in 2024. Plans include a new building at Watford General Hospital to house all clinical services with our hospitals at Hemel Hempstead and St Albans being refurbished throughout with some new buildings.  But our redevelopment is not just about new buildings. Each of our three hospitals will have a clearer role and a higher level of specialist care. This is a unique chance to be at the forefront of national efforts to transform how healthcare is provided for local people. Our hugely experienced project team of senior clinicians, architects, planners and construction experts have shaped our plans which embrace the latest best practice, including advances in design and digital healthcare.  The Trust is delighted to have recently been awarded Teaching Hospital status in recognition of its wide and well-renowned role in educating doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. We have recently opened a multi-storey car park at Watford General Hospital.  We encourage and welcome people with disabilities. If you need help, please ask.
